eProsima is focused in networking middleware and tools for high performance distributed systems and our products are
customer driven.
Over the years we have excelled in several areas of expertise: low latency, high throughput, small footprint, low
bandwidth consumption, optimum protocol, low CPU use, etc., working under various scenarios, from high-performance
systems with high speed reliable links, to small devices connected over unreliable radio links.

*eProsima Discovery Server* is an application that simplifies the use and testing of the new
[eProsima Fast DDS](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/) discovery capabilities.
*eProsima Fast DDS* allows a centralized, non-standard, client-server discovery mechanism that:

- extends *eProsima Fast DDS* use to non-unicast network transports like TCP, and
- speeds up the discovery-stage in a large number of participants scenarios.
