eProsima is focused in **networking middleware and
 tools for high performance distributed systems** and our products are customer driven.
 Over the years we have excelled in several areas of expertise: **Low latency, high throughput, small footprint,
 low bandwidth consumption, optimum protocol, low cpu use, etc.** working under very different scenarios,
 from high-performance systems with high speed reliable links, to small devices connected over unreliable radio links.

**eProsima Discovery Server** is an application that simplifies the use and testing of the new
[Fast RTPS](http://eprosima-fast-rtps.readthedocs.io) discovery capabilities. Now Fast RTPS allows a centralized,
 non-standard, client-server discovery mechanism that:

+ extends Fast RTPS use to non-unicast network transports like TCP.

+ speeds up the discovery-stage in a large number of participants scenarios.
